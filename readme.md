This is one of my first experments with creating a Bot using the Twitter API
The project is active under the Twitter handle  @claudio_Erin [a link](https://twitter.com/claudio_erin).

I had to make adjustments to the bots adding two Requirments for the bot to Retweet any message
* Only allowing the bot to Retweet people the bot follows
* The bot must be twitted at directly with Hashtag #learninpublic

The bot then Retweets the orginal message with a positive note.I discovered that I needed to add safety permaters after activing the bot for five seconds and the bot Retweet 135 messages during that span

After first activting the bot I realized how easy it is for nefarious
