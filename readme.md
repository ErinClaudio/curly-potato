DESCRIPTION 

Handle: @claudio_Erin

This is one of my first experiments with creating a Bot using the Twitter API. I had to make adjustments to the original design of the bot adding two Requirments for the bot to Retweet any message
Only allowing the bot to Retweet people the bot follows
The bot must be messaged at with Hashtag #learninpublic

HIGHLIGHTS

The bot then Retweets the original message with a positive note. I discovered that I needed to add safety parameters after activating the bot for five seconds, and the bot Retweet 135 messages during that span.
After first activating the bot I realized how easy it is for nefarious individuals to manipulate any hashtag.
